# Github Optimal App

Created using React, TypeScript, CSS in JS, Basic CI/CD and Google Charts. I used Github's API as I was more familiar with it. 

### If I had more time
- I would have used Typescript everywhere in the project and would have not used the type :any in my typescript code.
- Made it responsive
- Used Redux instead of using useReducer and context
